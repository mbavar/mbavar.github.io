My PhD thesis was focused of theory of computation, specifically implication of quantum computing to Theoretical CS, in particular [PCP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem) and the [Unique Games Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture) in the quantum world. My advisor was Prof. [Madhu Sudan](http://madhu.seas.harvard.edu/). 

Here is a selected set of publications.
