My PhD was focused of theory of computation, specifically implication of quantum computing to Theoretical CS, and more specifically [PCP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem) and [unique games conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture) in the quantum world. Here is a selected set of publication.
