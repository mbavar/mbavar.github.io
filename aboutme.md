I graduated from MIT in 2017 with a PhD in Theoretical CS. I currently work at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as a research fellow doing machine learning research. Prior to this, from March 2018 to July 2020, I was a Software Engineer at [Rubrik](https://www.rubrik.com/) in Palo Alto, CA working on distributed systems, cloud, and backend technologies.

My interests are broadly in distributed systems and machine learning.
